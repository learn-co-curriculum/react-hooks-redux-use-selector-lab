# Provider/MapStateToProps Lab

## Objectives
Use the react-redux library to connect the store to the react application.  
Utilize the Provider, and connect functions in the process.

## Overview

We will be continuing with our users application.  Previously, we could update the store by submitting a form, however without the react-redux library, we could not properly re-render our application components with changes to the store.  Here we will use the connect function to pass updates to the store to the relevant component.

## Instructions

Use the mapStateToProps function from the redux library to properly update the react application with the redux data.
